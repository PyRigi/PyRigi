    Parameters
    ----------
    G:

    red_edges:
        Edges in the red color - used to create components.
    blue_edges:

    `True` if the coloring has no almost cycles with a single blue edge.

    Suggested Improvement
    ----------------------
    Keep cached graph with no edges for multiple runs,
    this has a potential of a big performance gain.
