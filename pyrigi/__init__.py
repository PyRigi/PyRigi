# Do not export internal functions yet!
# Internal functions are not exported until the graph's monolit design is decomposed.
# To use pyrigi.Graph class safely in external functions, typing has to be used.
# As these functions are referenced also in the Graph clss itself, a dependency
# cycles is formed. Therefore, (probably) the best approach is to use
# nx.Graph in external functions for now and call Graph's methods
# in unsafe way till the monolit is decomposed and we can switch
# directly to calling new functions (previous methods) directly.
