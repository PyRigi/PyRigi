<!-- start-input -->

PyRigi is a Python package for research in rigidity and flexibility of bar-and-joint frameworks.
We aim at providing a tool for investigating combinatorial and geometric questions
such as infinitesimal, global, minimal, or generic rigidity. 


We use [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) for graph theory and [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/) for symbolic and numerical computations.
We acknowledge these and all the other open-source projects upon which PyRigi is based.

## Installation and usage

We have not reached a stable version yet,
but the latest version requiring at least Python 3.10
can be installed by
```
pip install pyrigi
```
Then it can be used by
```python
from pyrigi import Graph, Framework
```

Alternatively, one can clone/download the package
from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/pyRigi/PyRigi).

## Documentation

The documentation of the `main` branch is available [online](https://pyrigi.github.io/PyRigi/).
For compiling it locally,
see the [development guide](https://pyrigi.github.io/PyRigi/development/howto).

An important part of the documentation is the mathematical background.
We specify the outputs of the methods in the package
by providing rigorous mathematical definitions.

## Questions and feature requests

We have a [Zulip chat](https://pyrigi.zulipchat.com),
where you can ask questions or propose new functionality.
If you want to get access to it, please send an email to
[this address](mailto:external.dc4f45edef70cb7e0c621ad50377d9f1.show-sender.include-footer@streams.zulipchat.com).
You can also use the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/PyRigi/PyRigi/discussions).

To report bugs or ask for new features, please create an [issue](https://github.com/PyRigi/PyRigi/issues/new/choose).

## Contributing

We appreciate contributions!
Do you have a research result
about rigidity or flexibility of bar-joint frameworks
that could be implemented?
[Let us know](https://github.com/PyRigi/PyRigi/issues/new/choose)!
Or even better, implement it and contribute to the package!

Besides coding, you can also help for instance
by extending the mathematical documentation or
creating tutorials.

If you want to contribute, please,
read the [development guide](https://pyrigi.github.io/PyRigi/development/howto)
and [contact us](mailto:external.dc4f45edef70cb7e0c621ad50377d9f1.show-sender.include-footer@streams.zulipchat.com).

The decision to create PyRigi was made by the participants of the workshop
[Code of Rigidity](https://www.ricam.oeaw.ac.at/specsem/specsem2024/workshop2/)
(March 11–15, 2024), which was part of the 
Special Semester on Rigidity and Flexibility at [RICAM](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ricam/), Linz, Austria.
