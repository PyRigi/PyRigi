## Generalized double bananas

:::{prf:definition} Generalized double banana
:label: def-generalized-double-banana

For $d\geq 3$ and $2\leq t\leq d-1$,
the graph $B_{d,t}$ is defined by putting $B_{d,t}=(G_1\cup G_2)-e$
where $G_i\cong K_{d+2}$, $G_1\cap G_2\cong K_{t}$ and $e\in E(G_1\cap G_2)$.
Note that the graph $B_{3,2}$  is the well known flexible $\mathcal{R}_3$-circuit,
commonly referred to as the _double banana_.

The family  $\mathcal{B}_{d,d-1}^+$ consists of all graphs of the form
$(G_1\cup G_2)-\{e,f,g\}$ where: $G_1\cong K_{d+3}$ and $e,f,g\in E(G_1)$;
$G_2\cong K_{d+2}$ and $e\in E(G_2)$; $G_1\cap G_2\cong K_{d-1}$;
$e,f,g$ do not all have a common end-vertex;
if $\{f,g\}\subset E(G_1)\setminus E(G_2)$ then $f,g$ do not have a common end-vertex.


:::{prf:theorem}
:label: thm-flexible-circuit-classification

Suppose $G$ is a flexible $\mathcal{R}_d$-circuit with at most $d+6$ vertices.
Then either

* $d=3$ and $G\in \{B_{3,2}\}\cup \mathcal{B}_{3,2}^+$ or
* $d\geq 4$ and $G\in \{B_{d,d-1}$, $B_{d,d-2}\}\cup \mathcal{B}_{d,d-1}^+$.

:::{prf:definition} t-sum
:label: def-t-sum

Given three graphs $G=(V,E)$, $G_1=(V_1,E_1)$, and $G_2=(V_2,E_2)$, we say that
$G$ is a _$t$-sum_ of $G_1,G_2$ along an edge $e$ if $G=(G_1\cup G_2)-e$,
$G_1\cap G_2=K_t$ and $e\in E_1\cap E_2$.
:::


:::{prf:lemma}
:label: lem-2-sum

Suppose that $G=(V,E)$ is the $2$-sum of $G_1=(V_1,E_1)$ and $G_2=(V_2,E_2)$.
Then $G$ is an $\mathcal{R}_d$-circuit if and only if $G_1$ and $G_2$ are both
$\mathcal{R}_{d}$-circuits.

Using this lemma we can create one family of generalized bananas in which
every element of the family is a $\mathcal{R}_d$-circuit.

A different generalization is as follows.

Let $\mathcal{M}=(E,r)$ be a matroid with finite ground set $E$ and rank function $r$.
A _circuit_ of $\mathcal{M}$ is a set $C\subseteq E$ such that $r(C)=|C|-1=r(C-e)$
for all $e\in E$. Jackson, Nixon and Smith {cite:p}`Jackson2024` introduced a
generalization to _$k$-fold circuits_ i.e. sets $D\subseteq E$ such that
$r(D)=|D|-2=r(D-e)$ for all $e\in D$, for some fixed integer $k\geq 0$.


:::{prf:lemma}
:label: lem-k-sum

Let $k\geq 1$ be an integer and let $G$ be the graphical 2-sum of two graphs $G_1$ and
$G_2$ along an edge $e$.
Suppose that $e$ is not a coloop in either $\mathcal{R}_d(G_1)$ or $\mathcal{R}_d(G_2)$.
Then $G$ is a $k$-fold circuit in $\mathcal{R}_d$ if and only if $G_1$ is a $k_1$-fold
$\mathcal{R}_d$-circuit and $G_2$ is a $k_2$-fold $\mathcal{R}_d$-circuit for some
$k_1,k_2\geq 1$ with $k_1+k_2=k+1$.

:::{prf:definition}
:label: def-B-d-d-1

Define $\overline B_{d,d-1}$ to be obtained from $B_{d,d-1}$ by adding back the edge $e$.
It follows that $\textrm{cl} (B_{d,d-1})=\overline B_{d,d-1}$, and so
$\overline B_{d,d-1}$ is a flexible 2-fold circuit in $\mathcal{R}_d$.
We define the triple banana $B^{(3)}_{d,d-1}$ to be the $2$-sum of $\overline B_{d,d-1}$
and $K_{d+2}$ again along $e$.
By {prf:ref}`Lemma <lem-k-sum>`, $B^{(3)}_{d,d-1}$ is a 2-fold circuit in $\mathcal{R}_d$.
Iterating this process, we get that the $(k+1)$-tuple banana $B^{(k+1)}_{d,d-1}$ is a
$k$-fold circuit in $\mathcal{R}_d$.

## $n$-Frustum

:::{prf:definition} $n$-Frustum
:label: def-n-frustum

Assume that $n\geq 3$. The graph $G=(V,E)$ is called the 
_$n$-Frustum_ if it is the Cartesian product
 $G=C_n\,\square \, K_2$ of a cycle graph $C_n$ on $n$ vertices 
 and the complete graph $K_2$ on two vertices.

As a {prf:ref}`framework <def-framework>`, the $n$-Frustum is 
typically realized as two regular $n$-sided polygons on circles 
centered in the origin of the Euclidean plane with radii $r_1<r_2$. 
It has a {prf:ref}`nontrivial infinitesimal flex <def-trivial-inf-flex>` 
given by the rotation of the outer polygon while the inner polygon remains 
fixed. This infinitesimal flex does not extend to a 
{prf:ref}`continuous flex <def-motion>`.

## Symmetric Graphs

:::{prf:definition} $C_k$-symmetric Graph
:label: def-Ck-symmetric-graph

Let $k\geq 4$ be an integer and let $\Gamma = \langle \gamma \rangle$
denote the multiplicative cyclic group of order $k$. We use $c_k$ to denote the anti-clockwise rotation around the
origin by $\frac{2\pi}{k}$. We denote the isomorphism which maps $\gamma$ to $exp(\frac{2\pi i}{k})$ by $\tau_k:\Gamma \rightarrow C_k$
for the group $C_k$ generated by $c_k$.

We say that a finite simple graph is _$\Gamma$-symmetric_, if there exists a homomorphism
$\Theta:\Gamma \rightarrow \text{Aut}(G)$. Finally, we say that a $2$-dimensional framework $F=(G,p)$ on $G$ is _$C_k$-symmetric_, if $G$ is $\Gamma$-symmetric and for all $\delta \in \Gamma$ and $v\in V(G)$ we have $\tau_k(\delta)\,p(v) = p(\delta v)$.

:::{prf:definition} Counterexample for the symmetry-adjusted Laman count with a free group action
:label: def-Cn-symmetric

Let $n\geq8$ be even, and let $C_n$ denote the anti-clockwise 
rotation around the origin by $2\pi/n$. Define a 4-regular 
graph $H_n=(V_n,E_n)$ on the vertex set $V_n=\{v_1,\dots,v_n\}$ 
such that each vertex $v_i$ of $H_n$ is exactly adjacent to 
$v_{i+1}$, $v_{i-1}$, $v_{i+3}$ and $v_{i-3}$ with $v_{n+k}=v_k$ 
and $v_{1-k}=v_{n+1-k}$ for $k\in \{1,2,3\}$.

Define a {prf:ref}`framework <def-framework>` $(H_n,p)$ on 
$H_n$ realized on the unit circle in $\mathbb{R}^2$ such that 
$p(v_1)=C_np(v_n)$ and $p(v_i)=C_np(v_{i-1})$ for all 
$2\leq i\leq n$. For some vector $t$ on the line from the 
origin to a vertex from $\{v_1,\dots,v_n\}$, such a framework 
has a 
{prf:ref}`nontrivial infinitesimal motion <def-trivial-inf-flex>` 
$m$ which satisfies the system of equations
\begin{equation*}
    m(v_i)=\begin{cases}
        t & \text{if } i \text{ is even}\\
        -t & \text{if } i \text{ is odd},
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
where $1\leq i\leq n$.

:::{prf:definition} Counterexample for the symmetry-adjusted Laman count which contains a joint at the origin
:label: def-Cn-symmetric-joint-at-origin

The previous example can be extended in the following way: 
add a vertex $u$ and the vertices $U_n=\{u_1,\dots,u_n\}$ 
to $H_n$ from the {prf:ref}`previous definition <def-Cn-symmetric>`. 
We also add the following edges to $H_n$:
1. For all $1\leq i\leq n$, add the edge $\{u,u_i\}$.
2. For all $1\leq i\leq n$, add the edge $\{u_i,v_i\}$.
3. For all $3\leq i\leq n$, add the edge $\{u_i,u_{i-2}\}$. 
Also add the edges $\{u_1,u_{n-1}\}$ and $\{u_2,u_n\}$.

Denote the edge set created in this way by $F_n$. This creates 
the graph $G_n=(V_n\cup\{u\}\cup U_n,~E_n \cup F_n)$.

As a framework, this graph can be realized extending the 
realization $p:V_n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ from before to 
$G_n$: $p(u)$ is placed at the origin, and the other $n$ vertices 
$\{p(u_1),\dots,p(u_n)\}$ are placed on a circle with radius $r>0$ 
so that that $p(u_1)=C_np(u_n)$ and $p(u_i)=C_np(u_{i-1})$ for 
all $2\leq i\leq n$. In this way, the new edges given in (iii) 
form two disjoint regular $n/2$-gons. The 
{prf:ref}`nontrivial infinitesimal motion <def-trivial-inf-flex>` 
from the previous example extends to a nontrivial infinitesimal 
motion of the new framework $(G_n,p)$ which rotates the two 
$n/2$-gons clockwise and anti-clockwise, respectively.
