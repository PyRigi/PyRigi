:label: def-globally-rigid-graph

A graph $G = (V,E)$ is called _globally $d$-rigid_,
if for every {prf:ref}`generic <def-gen-realization>` $d$-dimensional {prf:ref}`framework <def-framework>` $(G,p)$,
all $d$-dimensional frameworks $(G,p')$ {prf:ref}`equivalent <def-equivalent-framework>` to $(G,p)$
are {prf:ref}`congruent <def-equivalent-framework>` to $(G,p)$.

Let $G$ be a graph, if $\Omega$ is an {prf:ref}`equilibrium stress matrix <def-stress-matrix>`,
its kernel is called _stress kernel_; we denote it by $K(\Omega)$ and its dimension by $k(\Omega)$.
We denote by $k_{min}(G,d)$ the minimal value of $k(\Omega)$ as $\Omega$ ranges over all
{prf:ref}`equilibrium stress matrices <def-stress-matrix>` of all
{prf:ref}`generic d-dimensional frameworks <def-gen-realization>` of $G$.

Let $G$ be a graph with $d+2$ or more vertices. If $G$ has a minimal {prf:ref}`stress kernel <def-stress-kernel>`

The converse of this theorem is the following one:

Let $G$ be a graph with $d+2$ or more vertices. If $G$ does not have a minimal {prf:ref}`stress kernel <def-stress-kernel>`
in $\RR^d$, then any $d$-{prf:ref}`dimensional generic framework <def-gen-realization>` $(G,p)$ is not globally $d$-rigid.

The following randomized algorithm from {cite:p}`GortlerHealyThurston2010` checks for global $d$-rigidity.

:::{prf:algorithm}
:label: alg-randomized-globally-rigid
**Input:** A natural number $d$ and a graph $G = (V, E)$ with at least $d + 2$ vertices

**Output:** `True` or `False`, whether or not $G$ is globally $d$-rigid

Let $n = |V|$ and $m = |E|$, let
$t = n\cdot d - \binom{d+1}{2}$, and $N = A \cdot n\cdot \binom{n}{2} +2$, where $A$ is some constant.

1. If $m < t$, output `False` (as the graph cannot even be generically $d$-rigid with so few edges), otherwise continue.
2. Pick a framework with integer coordinates randomly chosen from 1 to $N$.
3. Pick an equilibrium stress vector in a suitably random way. (If $m = t$, there are no stresses, so we consider the zero vector.)
4. Consider the corresponding equilibrium stress matrix and compute its rank.
5. If the rank is $n-d-1$ then return `True`, otherwise return `False`.

The above algorithm may give false negatives as the following theorem tells.

:::{prf:theorem}
:label: thm-globally-randomize-algorithm
The randomized {prf:ref}`algorithm for checking global d-rigidity<alg-randomized-globally-rigid>` never returns a false positive answer,
and returns a false negative answer with probability bounded above by $nm/N$, where $n$ is the
number of vertices, $m$ is the number of edges and $N$ is an arbitrarily large integer.
Given a number $A$, we chose $N \geq A\cdot nm + 2$
so that the probability of getting a false negative
is less than $1/A$.
In particular, checking for generic global $d$-rigidity is in $RP$, i.e.,
the class of randomized polynomial time algorithms.

a non-adjacent 2-linked pair of vertices with {prf:ref}`local connectivity <def-kappa-G-u-v>` $\kappa_G(u,v) \geq 3$.
Then $\{u,v\}$ is {prf:ref}`weakly globally 2-linked <def-globally-linked>` in $G$ if and only if either
* $\{u,v\}$ is a {prf:ref}`separating pair <def-separating-set>` in G, or
* $C(B,V_0)$ is {prf:ref}`globally 2-rigid <def-globally-rigid-graph>`,

is a subgraph of $B$ with $u,v \in V_0$ such that $B_0 + uv$ is an $\mathcal{R}_2$-{prf:ref}`circuit <def-matroid>`,
and $C(B, V_0)$ is the graph obtained as follows.

Let $V_1,\dots, V_r$ be the vertex sets of the {prf:ref}`connected components <def-k-connected>` of $B-V_0$.
Delete from $B$ the vertex sets $V_i$ for $1\leq i\leq r$
and add the edges $xy$ for all pairs $x,y \in N_B(V_i)$ for $1\leq i\leq r$.
Here $N_B(V_i)$ denotes the set of nodes of $B-V_i$ that are connected by an edge to some vertex of $V_i$.
The resulting graph is $C(B, V_0)$.
