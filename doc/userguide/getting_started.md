# Getting started

Jupyter notebook version of this page can be downloaded {download}`here <../notebooks/getting_started.ipynb>`.

The latest stable version of PyRigi can be installed by
```
pip install pyrigi
```
More detailed installation instructions can be found [here](installation-guide).

Once the package is installed, the basic classes {class}`~pyrigi.graph.Graph` and {class}`~pyrigi.framework.Framework` can be imported as follows:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from pyrigi import Graph, Framework
```

We can specify a graph by its list of edges, see [this tutorial](graph-tutorial) for more options.

```{code-cell} ipython3
G = Graph([(0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (0,3)])
G
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
G.plot()
```

Having graph `G`, we can construct a framework.

```{code-cell} ipython3
F = Framework(G, {0:[0,0], 1:[1,0], 2:[1,'1/2 * sqrt(5)'], 3:[1/2,'4/3']})
F
```

Notice that in order to keep the coordinates symbolic, they must be entered as strings (or SymPy expressions).

We can plot frameworks and graphs, see also the [Plotting](plotting-tutorial) tutorial.

```{code-cell} ipython3
F.plot()
```

Positions of vertices can be read using square brackets:

```{code-cell} ipython3
F[2]
```

There are also some predefined graphs and frameworks, see {mod}`~pyrigi.graphDB` and {mod}`~pyrigi.frameworkDB` (also [this tutorial](tutorial-framework-database))

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pyrigi.frameworkDB as frameworks
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
TP_inf_flex = frameworks.ThreePrism('parallel')
TP_inf_flex.plot()
```

There is also a possibility to [draw a graph using mouse](graph-drawer-tutorial).

## Rigidity properties

+++

Various rigidity properties can be checked by calling class methods, some examples are below.
See also [this tutorial](rigidity-tutorial).

+++

### Infinitesimal rigidity

+++

The framework of 3-prism created above is {prf:ref}`infinitesimally flexible<def-inf-rigid-framework>`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
TP_inf_flex.is_inf_rigid()
```

It has the following {prf:ref}`rigidity matrix <def-rigidity-matrix>`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
TP_inf_flex.rigidity_matrix()
```

The space of nontrivial {prf:ref}`infinitesimal flexes <def-inf-rigid-framework>` is generated by:

```{code-cell} ipython3
TP_inf_flex.nontrivial_inf_flexes()
```

### Generic rigidity

+++

Now we retrieve the underlying graph and check that it is (generically) {prf:ref}`2-rigid <def-gen-rigid>`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
G_TP = TP_inf_flex.graph
G_TP.is_rigid()
```

It is also {prf:ref}`(generically) 1-rigid <def-gen-rigid>`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
G_TP.is_rigid(dim=1)
```

No combinatorial characterization is known for 3-rigidity, but a randomized algorithm can be used based on {prf:ref}`thm-probabilistic-rigidity-check`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
G_TP.is_rigid(dim=3, algorithm="randomized")
```

    We can check also {prf:ref}`global <def-globally-rigid-graph>` or {prf:ref}`redundant <def-redundantly-rigid-graph>` rigidity:

```{code-cell} ipython3
G_TP.is_globally_rigid()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
G_TP.is_redundantly_rigid()
```
