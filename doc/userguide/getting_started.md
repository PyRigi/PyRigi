# Getting started

Jupyter notebook version of this page can be downloaded {download}`here <../notebooks/getting_started.ipynb>`.

## Installation

We have not reached a stable version yet,
but the latest version requiring at least Python 3.10
can be installed by
```
pip install pyrigi
```

Alternatively, one can clone/download the package
from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/pyRigi/PyRigi).
Installation for development is done via [Poetry](#dev-dependencies). 
More detailed installation instructions depending on your operating system can be found [here](installation-guide).

+++

## Usage

Once the package is installed, the basic classes can be imported as follows:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from pyrigi import Graph, Framework
```

We can specify a graph by its list of edges.

```{code-cell} ipython3
G = Graph([(0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (0,3)])
G
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
G.plot()
```

Having graph `G`, we can construct a framework.

```{code-cell} ipython3
F = Framework(G, {0:[0,0], 1:[1,0], 2:[1,'1/2 * sqrt(5)'], 3:[1/2,'4/3']})
F
```

Notice that in order to keep the coordinates symbolic, they must be entered as strings (or SymPy expressions).

```{code-cell} ipython3
F.plot()
```

Positions of vertices can be read using square brackets:

```{code-cell} ipython3
F[2]
```

There are also some predefined graphs and frameworks, see {mod}`~pyrigi.graphDB` and {mod}`~pyrigi.frameworkDB` (also [this tutorial](tutorial-framework-database))

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pyrigi.frameworkDB as frameworks
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
TP_flex = frameworks.ThreePrism('parallel')
TP_flex.plot()
```

## Rigidity properties

+++

Various rigidity properties can be checked by calling class methods, some examples are below.

+++

### Infinitesimal rigidity

```{code-cell} ipython3
TP_flex.is_inf_rigid()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
TP_flex.rigidity_matrix()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
TP_flex.nontrivial_inf_flexes()
```

### Generic rigidity

```{code-cell} ipython3
G_TP = TP_flex.graph()
G_TP.is_rigid()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
G_TP.is_rigid(dim=1)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
G_TP.is_rigid(dim=3, combinatorial=False)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
G_TP.is_globally_rigid()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
G_TP.is_globally_rigid(dim=1)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
G_TP.is_redundantly_rigid()
```

### Graph drawer

+++

A graph can be also drawn using mouse: when executed in JupyterLab, the following code displays a canvas.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from pyrigi import GraphDrawer
Drawer = GraphDrawer()
```

At any moment, the currently drawn graph can be retrieved and used further.

```{code-cell} ipython3
Drawer.graph()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```
