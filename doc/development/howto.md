## Communication

We use a [Zulip chat](https://pyrigi.zulipchat.com) for the communication among contributors.
If you want to get access to it, please send an email to
[this address](mailto:external.dc4f45edef70cb7e0c621ad50377d9f1.show-sender.include-footer@streams.zulipchat.com).
Feel free to ask any questions regarding PyRigi in a Zulip channel.

You can come with your own ideas on what to develop or you can check the channel
[To be implemented](https://pyrigi.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/444087-To-be-implemented)
for some suggestions about what the maintainers would be happy to have in PyRigi.
